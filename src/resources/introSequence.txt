There's an eerie silence...
Suddenly! You hear a voice!
It is a feeble old man.
Traveller... tell me your name
I see. Quite an interesting name you have, 
I also see thar you have a party of Heroes with you. Tell me about them...
Please, tell me: what kind of hero is the first one?
Now. Tell me: what kind of hero is the second one?
Now finally, tell me this: what kind of hero is the third?
I give you, oh traveller, my blessings...
but before you go... Tell me this.
What faction do you ally yourself with? The Dragon, or, the Lion?
YOU FOOL!
DID YOU NOT REALIZE? COULD YOU NOT SEE?
I AM THE 
AND I SHALL NOW RELEASE MY MINIONS UPON YOU!
I WILL NOW TEACH YOU WHAT TRUE FEAR IS!
